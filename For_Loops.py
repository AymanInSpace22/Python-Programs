# For Loops

# dont forget the colon
# this just prints out each element in your list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in numbers:
    print(item)

print()

# the while loop version
i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
    print(numbers[i])
    i += 1

print()

# Range Function
numbers = range(3, 20)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

print()

# you can add the third value so it will count or skip by that number
numbers = range(3, 20, 3)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

print()

# another way of doing it
for number in range(5)
    print(number)



# Tuples
# similar to lists
# with lists you use square brackets. With tuples you use paranthesis
# tuples are immutable. Meaning you can not change them once they are done
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
numbers.
